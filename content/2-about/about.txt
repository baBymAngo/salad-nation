Hey everyone! I'm Liam, and as you can tell, I love food! Food is such a glorious thing. It makes up who we are spiritually, intellectually, and physically. It connects us to who we are, what we are, and where we come from. 

Thinking of and preparing food it one of my greatest pleasures. I started cooking when I was little. It all started one day a family of five living in Georgia concocted a cleaver plan to get all the warm, gooey cookies they ever wanted. 

"I want cookies," someone would say. "Yeah," I said. "Cookies sound really good. Why doesn't someone make some?" My brother shot an expecting glace at my sister. My sister redirected his stare to my father. My father would scowl and search for my mother. And then my mother, a twinkle in her eye, would say, "But Liam makes them the best. Right everybody?" They all agreed. "Yeah, I want Liam's cookies," they would say with a devilish smirk. 

I tried to protest, but they were adamant. My cookies were the best, they said. Soon it didn't matter that they were lying. Over the years I had so much practice making cookies, they really were the best. I started to wonder what they rest of the culinary world had in store, and was eager to assist my mother in the kitchen. 

The world of food has only continued to grow from that day. I'm so grateful for all the experiences that led me to discover the nearly endless creative possibilities that go into every meal. That passion is what drives me to share my creations. 

The dinner table is a hallowed place, and I hope that through this small collection of recipes I can, in some way, be a part of yours.
