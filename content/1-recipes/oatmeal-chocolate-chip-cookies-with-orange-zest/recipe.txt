Title: Flawless, Gooey Chocolate Chip Cookies

----

Introduction: Here it is folks. Where it all started. Cookies. I've spent my life in search of the perfect, fluffy cookie recipe. Since I was 5, I've dreamed of one day wielding the coveted sorcery of our grandmothers to produce those flawless, golden brown cookies every time. The key is in the texture. How do you get a cookie that isn't flat and greasy, nor light and cakey, but perfect. I've tried all the old tricks, switching out half the butter with Crisco, refrigerating the dough before baking, using special backing sheets, and I'm here to tell you it's all a crock of shit. This technique has never failed me, so try it and see for yourself!

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Put the butter in an oven-safe bowl and leave in the preheating oven for a two or three minutes. Watch the butter closely and remove when nearly half the butter has melted. Leave the butter on the counter to come back to room temperature. You can speed up this process by putting the butter in the freezer for a few minutes, but be careful not to let the top get crusty. 

Once the butter has solidified, add brown and white sugar to the bowl and whip mixture until fluffy. This process is called creaming. A common mistake is creaming the butter too much. Whip just until mixture is fluffy, then stop. Add your eggs one at a time and whip into the butter-sugar mixture. Add the vanilla. 

In a separate bowl, combine your dry ingredients and stir with a fork until all is evenly distributed. Pour about half into your butter mixture and mix carefully until absorbed. Add the second half now, and crank that sucker until a hard dough is formed. Add chocolate chunks and knead into the dough. 

Form the dough it's 1/4 cup balls. There are lots of methods out there to get a perfectly round cookie ball, such as using a melon baller, but I still think it's better to form the cookies the old-fashioned way by rubbing them in between your palms. Also, bigger cookies always turn out better. Don't ask me why.

Place cookie balls on a baking sheet and bake for about 11 minutes. Ovens vary a lot in temperature, so make sure to watch your precious cookies closely. Take them out just when you start to see brown spots appear on the top. Remember, once you take them out they will continue to cook on the sheet while cooling.

Let the cookies cool for about 4 minutes. Then enjoy your perfect cookies!
