Instructions: 

Begin by heating the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. 

Season the thighs generously with salt and pepper, and rub in. Cook the thighs on both sides until golden-brown, and set aside. Don't worry if you get some chunks sticking to the bottom. These bits of burnt meat are called the fond, and will add delicious flavor to your broth. When cooled, dice the chicken into 1-inch thick chunks. 

Now, in the same pot, melt your butter and toss in the rosemary until fragrant. Make sure to scrape up all those brown pits off the bottom of the pan. 

Add onion and garlic, and saute until translucent. Then, add carrots, celery, thyme and marjoram. Cook until everything softens, about 5 minutes. Throw in mushrooms and cook 3 more minutes. 

Add chicken broth along with the bay leaf, peas, and chopped chicken thighs. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer.

While the soup is simmering, in a small bowl add the flour to the room-temperature butter and mash until combined. Ladle a small about of broth into mixture and whisk until combined. Repeat this for 2 or 3 ladle-fulls of broth. 

Now, add that to the thickened broth to the soup pot and mix well. Over the next 3-4 minutes, the soup will get noticeably thicker. Simmer for 10 minutes and serve warm.

Note: If making for a large crowd, adding some noodles or rice could help the dish stretch over a few more servings if desired.
