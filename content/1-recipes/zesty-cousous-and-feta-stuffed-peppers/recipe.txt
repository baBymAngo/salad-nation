Title: Zesty Cousous and Feta-Stuffed Peppers

----

Introduction: Stuffed Peppers are one of my favorite lunch items, which is why it kills me to see so many bland recipes floating around. Maybe it's because peppers look so colorful  and delicious that people forget where their spice racks are. Don't be fooled! Vegetables and fruits have a lot of water, and like a lot of vegetarian dishes, cooked peppers need a lot of kick to keep them from tasting too watery. So bring your game face and let's jump right in!

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and coat a baking dish with olive oil.

*If you're going with the non-vegetarian option, then brown your sausage over medium heat removing the casings if necessary. Drain, and set aside.*

Bring the vegetable broth to a boil, add couscous, then cover the pan and remove from heat until all liquid had been absorbed. 

Meanwhile, cut the hats off of the peppers and clean out all seeds and membranes so they look like little bowls. When selecting peppers, try to pick ones that have a fat bottom so they stand up. Place the peppers upright in the baking dish, roast them for 15 minutes so they soften up a little. Set aside.

Now, prepare the filling. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and dump in the fennel seeds. Saute seeds in the hot oil until fragrant. Then, add onion, garlic, zucchini, squash, oregano, cayenne pepper, and salt. Cook until vegetables are soft, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and add tomatoes, garbanzo beans, tomato paste, and couscous (also the sausage if using). Toss well until everything is combined. Add feta.  

Fill the peppers with the couscous stuffing and lay them upright back in the baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, let cool, and enjoy.
