Title: Roasted Red Pepper & Bacon Soup

----

Introduction: Zingy and rich, creamy and smokey. Folks, I've made a lot of butternut-squash soups in my day, but this one tops them all.  There are so many flavors your taste buds will be begging for more. My favorite part is the subtle hint of goat cheese that brings the whole mouth-watering dish to a creamy climax. The toppings really make our break this one so don't be stingy. Live it up!

Instructions: 

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Lightly coat a baking sheet with olive oil.

Place your chopped butternut squash, onion, bell pepper, garlic, and raw bacon into a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Once all surfaces are coated, lay everything out in a single layer on the baking sheet.

Place vegetables into the oven and roast for 25-30 minutes making sure to stir them at the halfway mark.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook bacon until brown and crispy. Transfer onto paper towels to drain. 

Heat a large stockpot over medium heat. Add butternut squash mixture and thyme, and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in chicken stock and puree with an immersion blender.

Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5-10 minutes. Add lemon juice.  If the soup is too thick, add more chicken stock as needed until the texture is perfect.

Serve immediately, garnished with bacon, goat cheese and chives.
