Title: Perfect Southern Style Biscuits

----

Introduction: Southern food gets a bad rap. I mean, not everyone likes buttered collard greens or pork rinds. But there are a few things that Southern cooks make like no other, and one of those things are warm, fluffy buttermilk biscuits. It's true. You haven't really had biscuits until you've had them served up on a big plate of gravy by someone named Mammy, or Nanna, or Pappy. The magic is all in the touch, and I'm gonna show you just how the pros do it. Let's get started!

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Combine your dry ingredients in a large bowl. For the butter, it is important that it be as cold as possible. Cut into little blocks (about 1/8 inch) and toss in with the dry ingredients. 

Now, this part can be the trickiest part to master so don't be discouraged if you don't get it perfect the first time. You have to get into the mixture with your fingers and break the small cubes of butter into sand sized pieces. Just squeeze the butter in between your fingers and rub outward. The small cubes of butter should shred, and eventually look like fine sand. Your technique will get better with practice. This step is important because it's what gives the biscuit its fluffiness. As the butter melts, it will release gas which gives the biscuit a nice "lift".

Make a well in the middle and pour in the cold buttermilk. Mix until all is combined, but no more. The dough should be quite wet. Turn the batter out onto a well floured surface and fold inward 1 or 2 times.

Pat, don't roll, the dough out into a 3/4 inch thick round. Using a biscuit cutter remove the formed biscuits and lay them on a backing sheet. It is very important that the edges be touching each other, this keeps the edges soft and helps the biscuits rise. After you're done, you can shape a final biscuit with the left over dough, but it won't be nearly as good as the first ones.

You can bush the tops with melted butter to give them a nice browned color if you wish, but I don't. Finally, put them in the oven and bake for 11-12 minutes or until golden-brown.

Serve hot, and enjoy!

Note: The less you handle the dough, the lighter and fluffier your biscuits will be. Practice is the key. The women who taught me made biscuits nearly every day! Don't give up the quest!
