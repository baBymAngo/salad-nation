Introduction: This delicious, savory winter soup will keep even the fiercest chills at bay. Full of tasty grains and veggies, it's just what your body is begging for to fight off those nasty winter colds. It's also a what I call "Chuck-it-all-in Stew". Got an old potato still loafing around in the pantry? Chuck it in! Need to finish off that last bit of celery in the fridge? Chuck it in! Still got half a box of pasta that you just can't get rid of? Chuck it in! This soup is so flexible. Just about anything goes. And if you're missing an ingredient or two, don't worry! You'll never know it was missing (except the bacon, that's just silly talk). So set yourself down in your favorite chair with a nice dark beer and your pipping hot stew, and live it up! No stress.

Instructions: 

Start out by rending the fat off of that glorious bacon on low heat for about 15 minutes until the edges are brown and crispy. Once most of the fat has liquefied, remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.

 Add a splash or two of olive oil and turn your heat up to medium.  Saute your red onion and garlic in the fat until fragrant. Then, add celery and carrot along with the bay leaf, cumin, oregano, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Saute veggies until soft, about 15 minutes.

The bacon can go back in now. Pour in the lentils and allow them to roast for 2 or 3 minutes in the pot. Douse the mixture with the white wine and stir until most of the wine has evaporated. Add the plum tomatoes, crushing the whole fruits in between your fingers (this is the best part as long as you don't make a complete mess). Add the vegetable broth and bring the stew to a boil. Now you can reduce the heat t low and simmer, uncovered, for 30-45 minutes or until lentils are soft. 

Finish with some olive oil, a glug or two of wine, and a healthy amount of sharp cheese. Enjoy!
