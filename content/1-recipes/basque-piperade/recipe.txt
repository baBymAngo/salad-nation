Instructions: 

Heat olive oil in a large sauce pan or wok over medium heat until the oil is fragrant. Add your onions and garlic, sauteing until translucent. Add your chili powder, paprika, and oregano and cook until fragrant.

Now add your whole tomatoes, can of tomato puree, red bell peppers, bay leafs, and sugar.  Squeeze the whole tomatoes between your fingers or with a metal kitchen spoon until they mash and release all their juice. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Bring the stew to a boil and then simmer for 25-30 minutes. 

Next, make 3-4 small indentions on the surface of your stew and crack the eggs in. Put a lid on your pan, turn the heat up to medium, and let the egg whites settle. Garnish with Italian parsley or cilantro. 

Grill or broil your slices of bread until nearly blackened. And serve with the stew.
