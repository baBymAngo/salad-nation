Title: Fruity Wild Rice Salad

----

Introduction: Salads are all about opening your mind. You have to embrace the possibilities. Greens are all well and good, and there are so many varieties and flavors to try, but the same can be said of many flora: like rice. I would put a nice wild rice mix up against salad greens in a beauty content any day. Look closely and you can see the kaleidoscope of colors just waiting to be savored.  Brown, chestnut, white, beige, tan, maroon. All these shades make their debut in the salad we are about to prepare. See you on the other side!

Instructions: 

Begin by thoroughly washing your rice in a large bowl under cold water. Fill bowl with water and toss rice with your hands then drain. Repeat until water runs clear.

Then, cook rice in 4 quarts of lightly salted, boiling water for 45 minutes. Note that wild rice will not get completely tender. This is okay. Drain thoroughly.

Add steamy rice mix to large bowl along with the bell peppers, onions (red and green), apple, cranberries, raisins, and nuts. To roast the nuts, simply heat them in a pan over medium high heat until fragrant. 

Then, make your dressing. In a non-reactive bowl whisk together olive oil, vinegar, jam, honey, salt & freshly cracked pepper. Pour over the rice mixture and and mix well. 

Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes until salad has chilled. Then, serve over a bed of baby spinach greens or similar salad mix. Top with more honey or vinegar, if preferred.
